A small addition to the story:

I moved these amps to a different room, where I had a switched power supply on a nearby socket: lots of whistling picked up when it was on!

So I soldered a couple of X2 0.22uF caps across the mains input terminals, and that stopped the noise completely ðŸ™‚

So for the complete solution:
1. Ensure the music source is clean
2. Strap mains earth to any metal case.
3. Use a 120Ohm resistor and 0.1uF X2 cap (parallel) between case and incoming signal ground
4. Use a 0.22uF X1 cap across the mains input to remove any RF.
