# GA28F
Information and materials for building and maintaining GA28F audio amplifiers

This pulls together much of the reference material I could find, just in case the forums hosting all of this
evaporate, especially due to the risk from the Online Safety Act.

The original thread is here https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/maplin-amplifier-ga28f-bk-module-mosfet-construction-thread.257488/ and it does keep growing, showing what the interest is in these. 

I first built my own integrated amp using these and a load of other Maplin projects back in 1985. It continued to work through until 1999 when the caps started to go - unfortunately it ended up in the dump as my wife wished for "junk" to go. Hence, I am now building another one, using my learnings from having built that one (and having battled with hum, and won).

Apologies in advance if anything here needs further attribution. Additionally please open a pull request for
either additional information, or if anything should be removed.
