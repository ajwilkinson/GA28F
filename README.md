Information and materials for building and maintaining GA28F audio amplifiers

This pulls together much of the reference material I could find, just in case the forums hosting all of this
evaporate, especially due to the risk from the Online Safety Act.

Apologies in advance if anything here needs further attribution. Additionally please open a pull request for
either additional information, or if anything should be removed.
